Yes, you can use GitHub with Obsidian to sync and back up your notes. Since Obsidian uses plain text Markdown files, you can store your vault in a Git repository and push updates to GitHub.

### How to Set Up GitHub for Obsidian:

1. **Install Git**: If you haven't already, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    
2. **Create a GitHub Repository**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), create a new repository, and do **not** initialize it with a README (you'll set it up locally).
    
3. **Initialize Git in Your Obsidian Vault**:
    
    - Open your Obsidian vault folder.
        
    - Right-click inside the folder and select **"Open Git Bash here"** (or use the terminal).
        
    - Run the following commands:
        
        ```sh
        git init
        git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
        ```
        
4. **Add and Commit Files**:
    
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    
5. **Push to GitHub**:
    
    ```sh
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    
6. **Automate Syncing (Optional)**:
    
    - Use the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) to automate commits and sync changes on a schedule.
        

This setup allows you to version-control your notes and access them from multiple devices. Would you like help setting up automation or resolving potential issues?
