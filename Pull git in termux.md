The error **"fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository"** occurs when Git detects that the repository is in a directory with unsafe ownership settings. This happens often in **Termux** because it runs in a different user environment compared to traditional Linux distributions.

### üîß **Fixing the Issue in Termux**

#### **Option 1: Mark the Repository as Safe**

Run the following command to mark the repository as safe:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)
```

This tells Git that the current directory is safe.

#### **Option 2: Allow All Repositories in Termux**

If you want to allow all repositories in Termux, run:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
```

This is a more general approach but should only be used if you're sure about security.

#### **Option 3: Check the Owner of the Repository**

If the issue persists, check the ownership of the repository:

```bash
ls -ld $(pwd)
```

If the repository is owned by a different user, you might need to change the owner:

```bash
chown -R $USER:$USER $(pwd)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Termux runs as a non-root user, so you might not be able to use `chown`. If that's the case, try cloning the repository again in a directory where you have full control, like `$HOME`.

### **After Applying the Fix**

Once you've made the changes, try pulling again:

```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```
